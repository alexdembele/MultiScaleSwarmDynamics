# MultiScaleSwarmDynamics  

The purpose of this project is to extend swarm-formation models to multiple abstraction levels, or scales.

To launch multi-scale simulation open Centroids.nlogo with NetLogo app, if you want to launch uni-scale simulation, open FlockingModified.nlogo. Then click on "setup" button and after than on "launch" button. You can adjust parameters and speed by using controls in top and bottom layers of simulation. If you want to conduct test, use Centroids.nlogo and the button experiment. It will write data in a csv file in data folder. TO process data, you can use generateurCourbe.py
